		<p> Hey! This website was built as an extension of a project that was developed for our 
            Computational Semantics class at UT Austin (LIN 350). Our machine learning model was
            inspired by a <a href="https://github.com/clips/news-audit"> Github</a> project,
			which attempted to achieve the same goal that we had: to determine whether a news article was sensationalized.
		</p>
		<p>
			The initial scraping of website information is done by <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">Newspaper</a>, a powerful
			tool used to extract metadata from news sites without having to do the dirty work ourselves. It is very accurate 
			and powerful and allowed the webapp to easily parse out the title and text information that is needed for our model.
		</p>
		<p>
			The model uses text analysis tools such as NLTK and Pattern to extract features from the text. We look
			at features including sentence structure, part-of-speech usage, sentence length, sentiment, punctuation, etc.
			to input into a neural network and produce a classification for the article as sensationalized or not sensationalized.
			While it would seem intuitive to go ahead and focus on the words used in sensational, bias pieces of text, we decided to 
			try experimenting with focusing on semantical usage instead (since most sensational text is subtle and not explicit.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Our model architecture works as follows (using NLTK, Pattern and Tensorflow):
			<ul>
				<li>Feature tagger that takes raw text -> numeric data vector</li>
				<li>Neural network architecture: one single convolutional layer, 
					three fully connected dense layers with 16 neurons, fully connected
					output layer with a single output neuron.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We trained this model on 16,000 training articles and 2,000 testing articles. Data set was extracted
			from the News Audit project. Below you can see the training accuracy of our model: 
			<img src="static/imgs/training.png" class="center" >
		</p>
		<p>
			After training our model to be around 95% accurate with the training set, we tested our model with the 
			test set and got an accuracy of around 96%, a 3-4% increase over the other models that used this same 
			data set.
		</p>
		
			<h2>Potential pitfalls:</h2>
		<p>
			Although our model has shown strong results, it still struggles with "fake news", data sets with sources
			such as "The Onion." Furthermore, structure of sensational texts can change in the future, and there will 
			be issues with that as well. In addition, this model is not good at articles that quote other sources, etc 
			so it may accidentally tag some sites as sensationalized (an error.)
