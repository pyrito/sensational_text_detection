		<p> Hey! This website was built as an extension of a project that was developed for our 
            Computational Semantics class at UT Austin (LIN 350). Our machine learning model was
            inspired by a <a href="https://github.com/clips/news-audit"> Github</a> project,
			which attempted to achieve the same goal that we had: to determine whether a news article was sensationalized.

			The model uses text analysis tools such as NLTK and Pattern to extract features from the text. We look
			at features including sentence structure, part-of-speech usage, sentence length, sentiment, punctuation, etc.
			to input into a neural network and produce a classification for the article as sensationalized or not sensationalized.

			Potential pitfalls:
